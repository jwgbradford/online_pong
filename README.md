# Online Pong

Builds on sock_chat to develop a simple online 2-player game of pong.

Has two players. Your player is always on the left, and the other (remote) player is on the right.

# To Do
may actually be easier to start fresh...
1 set game class in server
2 switch to json
3 check data being sent / key values in json not pickle pygame objects

# known bugs
None at the moment, but it's pretty simple
